# aider is AI pair programming in your terminal

If you want the actual aider README, look there: https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider

This is a fork of aider that is meant to be used with the aider-client extension for VSCode.
It is also my playground for some future features I want to add to aider.

The interesting branches at the moment:
- main: contain most of my staff
- ctx-issue-rearrange: feature that allow to add github issue to context
- line-numbers: a stage on the way to the vscode extension

At the moment, the new commands used for the extensions are available from `main`.
